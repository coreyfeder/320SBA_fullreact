Some talented people can say, "I'm a vegetarian" in Vietnamese, "where can I bathe?" in Bangla, and "I need a hospital!" in Hindi. The rest of us may need a little help. Until AI proves more reliable than that linguistic prankster known as "Google Translate," don't risk embarrassing pronunciation missteps and dangerous misunderstandings. _See_ exactly what you're saying.

Now, you can propose drinks and dancing to that dapper dude despite not knowing Dutch, and you can successfully and safely sample the specialty Scandanavian sushi without a single word of Swedish Sign Language OH FOR GOD'S SAKE THIS IS @%&^%$# UP I QUIT
